# Brain-tumor-detection

 We have proposed segmentation of the brain MRI images for detection of tumors using K-Means clustering technique. A cluster can be defined as a group of pixels where all the pixels in certain group defined by similar relationship. Clustering is also unsupervised classification because the algorithm automatically classifies objects based on user given criteria. Here K-Means clustering algorithm for segmentation of the image is used for tumor detection from the brain MRI images.
